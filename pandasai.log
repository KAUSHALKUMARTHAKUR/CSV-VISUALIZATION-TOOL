When you trigger the condition required by the Ghost Rule in the level, you will receive a 'deadly attack'. The player can use items to neutralize this attack. Once in the level the player was very lucky that the 'rule' did not trigger, bringing all the items back to the safe zone. It is also possible to trigger the 'rule' of the Ghost continuously in the level, resulting in an early return to the safe zone. Even return the archive to its original appearance. Players can cleverly use a variety of items to complete the level. You can also gain insight into and seize the rules of the Ghost, and run amok in the level. Players can also use ghost rules to attack other ghosts. Players need to decide the strategy according to their own situation, and the Great God's walkthrough can only be used as a reference, trust me. Now let's talk about what 'rules' are. A 'rule' is a condition that needs to be observed within its effective scope, and when the 'rule' is violated, certain penalties will be imposed. A few simple examples of 'rules' to facilitate the player's understanding, but also introduce the current 'rules' in the 'rules' of several elements, later will add more elements. 1: movement Example 1 No Jumping: Jumpers will be attacked if they are in effect, but not if they are not jumping. Example 2 No walking: People who walk within the effective limits will be attacked, if not walking will not be attacked. Example 3 Must jump: Those who do not jump within the effective range will be attacked. 2: Behavior Example 4 Item Pickup: Items picked up within the effective range will be attacked, if not picked up will not be attacked. Example 5 Open the door: Open the door within the effective scope will be attacked, if not open the door will not be attacked. 3: Relative position in space Example 6 Prohibit ahead: The player or the Ghost will be attacked when they are in front of the Rule holder. Example 7 Forbidden Above: The player or the Ghost will be attacked when they are above the Rule holder. 4: time Example 8 Do not stay for 10 seconds: Stay for 10 seconds within the effective range will be attacked. Example 9 Must stay for 10 seconds: You must stay for 10 seconds within the validity range. If you leave the validity range without staying for 10 seconds, you will be affected. 5: Speed Example 10 No Running: When the player reaches running speed, they will be attacked. Example 11 Forbidden to Stay: When the player stays in place without moving, it will be attacked. The above are the current 'rules' of the 'rules' of the generation elements, the player can infer the 'rules' of the ghost according to the above elements, the current 'rules' will only have 1 or 2 elements. As for how the player can obtain the 'rules', when the ghost is attacked by other 'rules' will fall asleep and stop activities, at this time the player can interact with the ghost, the player answers the right 'rule' will be included in the safe zone.Please note that the wrong answer will be attacked. ghost: A challenger who cannot return and remains in the level forever. Each ghost has a unique 'rule' and will be attacked when a challenger or other ghost meets the conditions. Deletion probability: The player will calculate the deletion probability after selecting the challenge difficulty, and when the player dies in the level, it will determine whether to delete the current save according to this probability.

Well-constructed houses are completely destroyed; structures with weak foundations blown away; The car drived by chaser will be thrown; large debris become flying missiles. F5 Tornado Wind speeds between 261 to 318 mph (419 to 512 km/h) Incredible damage Most structures severely damaged or completely destroyed. the car drived by chaser will become flying missiles. The player only need to wait for 80 seconds after the second player joined in, the game will start. The tornado will dynamically downgrade to the corresponding level according the number of the chasers. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A letter to player: As an office worker, I eager to chase a tornado, but now I have a family to take care. So I decided to realize my dreams in the virtual world. I have developed two mobile game four year ago on app store. I self-learn unity from 2015. So I decide to use the unity to make a game. In the game I can pursue the tornado. In order to be as realistic, I review a large number of papers, watch a lot of tornado video on youtube. I hope I can simulate the tornado and experience the excitement in the virtual world. From June 2017, I started to use the off-duty time to develop alone. I make a sigle game in a few months. The physical damage, movement and driving effects of different buildings, sundries, glass, animals and vehicles in the EF0-EF5 tornado are total simulated based on the Fujita series. I play it in different scenes for a period. And I thought why I am not share it with more people to experience it. Then I start develop multiplayer game using Unet. And I did it. But unfortunately, when I complete the game two days latter, I received a Email from the unity. The Email noted that it will not support Unet service next year. I am almost crazy. I pondered the difficult of continue with this project in about a month. I decide to try again. I look for alternatives. I want to set up a server by myself. I have set up a server many years ago. But I don't know how to make the unity connect with a local server. I want to use third part service. I found the photon can support the unity easily. I buy a template having photon and unity. That's cost a lot of time. Now, I did it again. I am very proud. In this game, players need against a tornado. I want to design that one player roles as tornado, the other players role as chaser. The number of chaser not limit. But it will not fun enough. So I made it as an asymmetric confrontation game, 4V1. In the future, maybe I will design a map with more than 4 chasers, a map with more than one tornado. Yes, I have designed a map with a lot of tornado last year, that's thrilling. I change the asymmetric confrontation game. The game can be start, if the room not full. The player only need to wait for 80 seconds after the second player joined. The tornado will dynamically drop to the corresponding level according the number of the chasers. Finally, I added rankings, dressups, rewards.

It has become her personal tradition — a tribute to her departed grandparents. Driven by a love for the woods that they had planted in her, she takes her dog, Ayda, and goes to their secret place. But, seeing that it had been emptied, she drives further, exploring an unknown, mysterious area. The story takes place in 2007, when Soviet cars had not yet lost their relevance. You will experience together with the heroine the fear and loneliness alone with unfriendly nature. Only the faithful dog will always keep you company. Always?

You can choose a normal size map and battle in a death match with a single AI opponent finishing within an hour or select a huge map and slug it out with the other 3 factions in a game of epic proportions. Players start by choosing one of four factions and building their playing decks. Each faction has its own play-style, strengths and weaknesses. There are 7 main card types: Heroes, Units, Facilities, Attack (Aircraft, Helo/Hover and Missile), Attachments, Munitions, Tactics. The game map is created randomly each time you play and seeded with resources and independent units and facilities. Your cards are played by drawing on your resource stockpiles. 4 basic resources are necessary to build your empire in the harsh new world. Humans, Materials, Energy and Technology are all strewn across the playing board. Some are concentrated in the ruins of human cities; others are found in the junk heaps of forgotten battlefields or simply lying buried in the vast wastes. Once the game is underway, you will want to deploy your heroes and units and explore the map. Some hexes will contain resources; some will harbor independents. These units and facilities range from human slavers, raiders and mercenaries to alien warlords, rogue machine masterminds and mutated monsters. Depending on your faction some will offer to join your cause (maybe for a price) while others will fight you to the death. With the map scouted out, your enemies located and your armies formed up, you will want to unleash the dogs of war. Everything costs Action Points, so plan your moves well. You might want to use some air power to soften up the enemy first. Attack cards are played from your hand and can strike enemy armies within range of your stronghold and outposts. Drag the Aircraft, Missile or Helo (Hover Ship) card and drop it on an enemy formation and the battle is joined. Your card’s attack strength is represented by die on the horizontal rolling area. The target’s defense strength is represented below yours by the die on the lower rolling area. Each die has 3 sides with the faction’s symbol denoting a success and 3 sides that are blank denoting failure. Both players roll their dice, count up their successes and then try and modify the results. Some aircraft as well as all heroes have fate points they can spend to re-roll Air to groundany die that failed. Tactic cards can be played to drastically change the results…add positive die to your pool, re-roll opponent’s die, turn them to failures, or even remove them. If the attacker rolls higher than the defender then the difference is applied as damage. Armies are represented by rectangular playing pieces on the board. Each army can contain 1 hero and up to 8 units (cards) but you will have to be careful not to exceed your hero’s command rating or their attack, defense and movement will suffer. When two non-stealthed armies meet in a hex a battle ensues. These battles can encompass multiple stacks of armies so you are first given the chance to determine the order in which they will fight. Battles are army versus army until one side is destroyed, gutted (only a leader remains) or retreated by their owner. The player remaining on the battle field with a combat capable army is the winner and gains control of the hex. Any surviving defeated units are subjected to a retreat attack if they opted to retreat and their heroes may be captured or killed in the rout. Capturing enemy heroes is particularly advantageous as they are interred in the nearest friendly stronghold or outpost and generate 1 bonus Action Point per player turn. Ground Combat is a brutal affair. Just like air attacks, your card’s attack strength is represented by die on the horizontal rolling area. The target’s defense strength is represented below yours by the die on the lower rolling area. Both players roll their die, count the successes and then try and modify the results. If the attack roll is greater than the defense roll then the difference is applied as damage to the defender. Once a unit attacks or performs a special ability it is marked as committed and may not take any further actions until the next round. Players take turns attacking or playing abilities until the end of the round is reached. Both players then have the chance to assess the situation and either withdraw the currently active armyground combat (each unit is subjected to a free attack), retreat all armies (again a free attack is taken as well as a capture/kill attempt for any heroes without units in their army) or continue the fight. If both sides elect to retreat than no free attacks are taken. To win the struggle for the wasteland you must occupy or destroy each of your enemies’ strongholds. It sounds simple enough but there are many paths to achieve that objective. You can wage a brutal straight forward ground campaign, develop a secret weapon in your laboratories and vaporize your enemy, or use stealth and sabotage to eliminate your enemy. The choice is up to you but keep in mind your enemies will be moving against you as well. All it takes is one good nuke to ruin your day.","Silvia isn't afraid of evil. Evil is her job.

It has all the amazing game play and beautiful art of a digital trading card game, but instead of having to chase down hard-to-find cards with each set release, you get unlimited copies of every card! In Epic, each player starts the game with a score of 30 health. Your goal is to eliminate your opponents by reducing their health to 0. You start the game with a hand of five cards, and draw a new card at the start of your turn. Your cards represent powerful champions that will fight for you or game changing events you can use to thwart your opponent. Each turn every player in the game gets one 'gold.' Some cards cost a gold to play, others are free. This means you can play any card in your hand from the very first turn. There is no slow building of resources in this game. Epic starts at full throttle! The four colors of Epic cards each represent a different alignment. Yellow is Good, red is Evil, blue is Sage, and green is Wild. Each alignment has its own strengths and weaknesses. You can play cards of any and all colors in your deck. If you can match colors, your cards will frequently get more powerful.","Dark Wish is an adventure game set in a harsh desert. Explore 'The Dust', a strange and unusual place filled with dangerous animals, bandits, and wanderers who pass on by. A linear but playful and unique story unfolds as you work towards your goal.

Key Features Exploration with story elements: Follow your main quest to escape the desert, but stop to meet unique and weird friends on the way. Turn based combat system: 'Beyond-turn' based, a twist to blend time between some actions and allows free movement.

With the buildings, you can then process logs into lumber, weave wool into textiles, grow plants with the Field and many more! Make your town thrive with all these useful buildings! You can also keep wild animals as pets too! Pets can go out with the pioneers to gather materials, or they can help in hunting, and even allow pioneers to ride on their backs! As you progress in colonizing the land, you may obtain 'Invention Cards' along the way. 'These cards provide various effects, such as shortening your farm harvesting time cycle, and increasing the fishing time and etc. ' There are over 290 cards in the game! Use them wisely! 3 Game Modes are in the game.

The story is told through newspaper articles, notes left by a disgruntled secretary, unwelcome letters, audio tape recordings and a unique journal that evolves throughout the game based on the player’s own insightful analysis of an unusual therapy session. THE STORY After the mysterious death of Dr. Pokorny, Dr. Novak, relatively unknown by many, takes over the illustrious psychotherapy practice. At the same time he inherits Mrs.Ruzicka, the secretary of the deceased psychologist. In the hands of Dr.Novak, the practice is less then flourishing. One morning, Dr.Novak receives a box of audio tapes – Recorded psychotherapy sessions to be exact – and he is asked to listen to them and give his insightful analysis of its content. Sadly, things take a turn for the worst for Dr.Novak. His troubled mind seems to be getting the best of him...Or does it? You decide. You are this psychotherapist. You are Dr.Novak ...And your task is to carefully analyze and give your insight on the recorded therapy sessions. Ultimately, your answers will determine your own fate, Dr. Novak. FEATURES Fully narrated psychotherapy sessions by Joseph K. Krachtovil himself. Three different endings based on the player’s insight. Interactive desktop with controllable timespans making days shorter or longer. Immersive storyline delivered to the player via letters, notes, journal entries and audio recording.

Fresh from the centrifuge, your chemical samples need to be sorted, but you can only pour a chemical onto itself or you risk remixing the solutions (except with the help of a little 'time travel' to undo). Get all the colors into their own test tubes to win. Speed things up by selecting multiple vials with the same chemical on top and move them all at once. Plan ahead and keep your vial selected after a move to use the next chemical right away. Each game is randomly generated, but you're in control of the challenge level by selecting how many chemicals you want. For added difficulty, try a hidden match where the only way to know what's in tube is to uncover it. Don't worry if you get into trouble, just add an extra helper vial to hold a small amount of chemical. Customize your experience by changing any color to whatever you want and if you still have trouble telling them apart, turn on the symbols for a little more visibility.","Three shapes. Two choices.
